# Sliding Cube Game
I made this project to learn how to use the Unity game engine. To do this, I followed a tutorial from the YouTube channel Brackeys.

After completing the tutorial, I added a level selection menu and an endless mode, which challenged me to test what I had learned.

# Where to play?
